### Automaticly running this script once a day
Use a chronjob on a raspberry.

- Add to crontab:
    + edit crontabe `crontab -e` (opens vi). If vi is not your friend and something goes wrong, you can exit and not save anything by pressing escape, then writing `:q!`. `:` on an american layoutis in the same spot as `shift + รถ` on a swedish layout.
    + Type: "Go" to jump to the last line (G) and enter insert mode on a new line below with o.
    + Write the following line: `5 2 * * * python3 afbs.py $botusername $botpassword $mailrecipient1 [$mailrecipient2]`
    + Exit and save by doing escape followed by `:wq`.
